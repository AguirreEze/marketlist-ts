## Marketlist

This is my take on the TradeHelm challenge, found on [Gonsy's Discord](https://discord.gg/hpM8rvRP).

I'll be using Next.js framework, SASS , MongoDB, Next-Auth.

## Requirements

- App functionality
  - Show a form to add elements on the list
  - Allow single element removal from list
  - Persist list on app re-opening

> in case of saving data on localStorage, simulate delay on loading, saving and deleting list elements.

- Required

  - Lint rules must be fullfiled
  - Fullfill visual specs

- Important

  - UX, minimize interactions needed to use the app
  - Order, files structure, keep simple

- Not required
  - Add unit test (Jest, react-resting-library)
  - Add intefration test (Cypress)
